# üñº Bin to PNG

Bin to PNG is a tool for extracting PNG images from bin files. 

## üí° Introduction

For some reasons we get some `bin` files, which are compiled PNG files. Now we want to extra them from bin files. 

There were many excellent games in Symbian period, most of such games with quite small size. To do this, developers always chose to compile picture materials from PNG format to bin format, and then archive them to Jar package for running. 

For now, if we want to extract some picture sources from those games, we have to extract PNGs from bin files. Here is a tool to help you do that. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirement 

``` Python
Python packages: os, re, binascii
```
